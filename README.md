# kivyic
An extension of KivyMD

Latest Version 0.1.dev6

A lot of the code and structure is based around KivyMD https://gitlab.com/kivymd/KivyMD

I just wanted to change the appearance, add some functionality and custom widgets for my development.

Currently in **alpha** status and not ready for use, but feel free to take a look and give me any ideas or issues you may see.
